# CD_Flex_Final_Project_KB
Demonstration of skills learned in Coding Dojo (Python Part-time) Flex Bootcamp.

As of 4/7/2022, 9:30pm, project not fully complete. Needs to be revisited, as Adding a new set to db is not working properly. Per the terminal, action for adding new set goes to adding a new moc, but does not add a new moc to the DB. 
So data submitted for new set is lost.  (help/comments on a crrect route are welcome)

Did not incorporate API; most likely candidate would be that from "Rebrickable.com", the most compatible/easy to maneuver. 

Did not correctly implement likes on Mocs as planned in diagram yet. Have a likes table in the ERD, but did not get to it in the code.

Wanted orignally to have the Mocs and Sets on the Welcome page be side by side, but when trying to implement them as columns, it didn't work properly. Also wanted the buttons to be at the bottom of the listings, but they both appeared at the tops of their respective sections. Not sure why. Might have classed them incorrectly. 

Did want to add images to the Mocs if possible, perhaps through an API, but again, did not get to it. 




Had a deadline for submission that I self-sabatoged myself on, thus this project is not currently complete. I will return to it in the coming weeks to try and figure out the other parts, but needed to submit for the final deadline. 

This app was something that took me too long to get my head around in terms of implementation or what I actually wanted to include. Might have bit off more than I could chew in the short amount of time I allotted myself. 
I will learn from this.
